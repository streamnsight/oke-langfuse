# OCI Generative AI Gateway Module

This module deploys and manages the OCI Generative AI Gateway application. 
It provisions the required Kubernetes resources, configuration, and integrations for running the Gateway on OCI infrastructure.

The OCI GenAI Gateway provided OpenAI compatible access to all OIC LLM Models via API keys.

This is needed to be useable with LangFuse using the OpenAI compatible LLM provider.
